00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,774
 After defeating the diabolical
      Doctor Thaddeus Blakk

4
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:44,777
      and sending him into
       the Deep Caverns--

5
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:47,579
    --never to be seen again,

6
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:52,584
 Eli Shane and his gang thought
     their battle was over.

7
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:57,056
   But the brave heroes barely
    had time to take a breath

8
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:01,326
       before a new enemy
      threatened Slugterra:

9
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:03,328
            The Goon!

10
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:09,334
  <i> A ghoul dark slug with nasty</i>
    <i> mind controlling powers.</i>

11
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:13,372
     <i> Eli and the Shane Gang</i>
      <i> defeated their foes,</i>

12
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:17,843
    <i> freeing the Dark Slinger</i>
  <i> from the Goon's evil thrall.</i>

13
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:23,715
<i>The Goon lost a lackey, and the</i>
   <i> Shane Gang gained an ally:</i>

14
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:29,455
 <i> Junjie, the mysterious slinger</i>
   <i> from the Eastern Caverns.</i>

15
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:31,323
     And there you have it!

16
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:35,561
 The latest tales of Slugterra's
        greatest heroes!

17
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:37,296
     So whaddya think kids?

18
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:40,432
      You wanna grow up and
     become a slug slinger?

19
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:44,203
  Well, you're gonna need guts!

20
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:45,671
     Do you have the guts!?

21
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:47,539
         And the drive?!

22
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,174
      The passion for it!?

23
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:53,679
     Well, it's a hard life,
       but it's exciting!

24
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:57,549
  Why, I bet the Shane Gang are
  off doing something right now

25
00:01:57,551 --> 00:02:01,720

         It's okay guys.

          Just a dream.

              Huh?

42
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,603
     Couldn't sleep either,
              Eli?

43
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:55,741
    Uh...No...the TV...it was
         a little loud.

44
00:02:55,743 --> 00:02:58,310
        I dreamt of fire
        and destruction,

45
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:01,446
      the Caverns in chaos
  under the shadow of the Goon.

46
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,182
   And a monstrous claw that--

47
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:04,416
            A claw?!

48
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:06,285
      I had the same dream.

49
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:10,355
     I fear it was more of a
    premonition than a dream.

     Well, whatever it was,

53
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,697
   I'm not going back to sleep
   with my head full of Goon.

54
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,433
    And the best way to clear
          my mind is--

55
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,703
     An early morning duel!

56
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:25,938
        Up for some fun?

57
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,374

             [yells]

83
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:20,419
        Thank you for an
       invigorating duel.

84
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:22,454
      So, you finally seem
       better after being

85
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:23,622
    under the Goon's control.

86
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:27,759
  Yes, and I'm eager to use all
  of my abilities to repay you

87
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,895
         for freeing me
   from the Goon's captivity.

88
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:31,596
    I still don't get how you
       control your slugs

89
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,432
    with that slug fu stuff.

90
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:37,336
  Well, I have done nothing but
  practice since I was a child.

91

         Ah, it's cool.

00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:41,473
           Follow me.

95
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,742
You can tell what sort of slug's
           been slung

96
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:45,610
       just by the sound?

97
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,045

00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,647
   And Stinky takes the lead!

114
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,998
      I do not understand.

115
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,635
   The slugs wear helmets that
   receive signals transmitted

116
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:45,437
       from the blasters.

    Forgive me, I understand
       what you are doing.

120
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:55,680
    What I do not understand
             is why.

121
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:59,951
    Why one would play a game
            for fun.

122
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,787
    Would this not take away
       time for training?

123
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:04,656
  Uh wait, you've never played
             a game?

124
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:08,560
  I was born to be my Caverns'
       greatest protector,

125
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:11,062
     and it is an honor with
         many benefits.

126
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,532
  One being, that I do not need
        modified blasters

127
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:16,668
    and technology to control
            my slugs.

        That is cheating!

           Something's

              Whoa!

00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:17,095
         Flatulorhinkus,
        Hoverbug, Slyren,

157
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,264
 and Tormato slugs have changed.

158
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:20,198
          This is bad.

159
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,133
        This is real bad!

160
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,738
            [growls]

161
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,106
            [chirps]

162
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,708
     It's still not working!

163
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,809
        What's going on?

164
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:31,776
             Oh, no!

165
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:32,978
              Look!

166
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,880
  Wind-Farm Cavern is overrun!

167
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:37,883
   That place practically runs
   on Hoverbugs and Tormatoes.

168
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:40,085
    That's as good a place as
 any to start figuring this out.

169
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:42,254
        Let's saddle up!

170
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,592
            [grunts]

171
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,633
            Let's go!

172
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,069
   Well, at least today can't
        get any crazier.

173
00:08:58,071 --> 00:08:59,304
             [gasps]

174
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:03,875
        The Shadow Clan!

175
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,812
           [whispers]

176
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:10,215
        I, uh, [chuckles]
    didn't quite catch that.

177
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,550
     He says we need to go.

178
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:14,686
    To a Shadow Clan village
       near Xanadu Basin.

179
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,588
     You speak Shadow Clan?

180
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,857
       Of COURSE you speak
          Shadow Clan.

181
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,559
          Xanadu Basin?

182
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,794
    It'll take us days to get
         there on mecha.

183
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:23,895
          We can't go.

184
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,664
    All of our air slugs have
          been ghouled

185
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,198
        and we're heading
        to Wind-farm so--

186
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,168
   Once you hear the message,

187
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,071
        I think you will
        change your mind.

188
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:33,939
            Message?

189
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:34,906
          What message?

190
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:39,044
        The message from
          your father.

191
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:40,145
             [gasps]

192
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:45,784
    If the glyph glows, call
  the son, so said Will Shane.

193
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,018
             What?!

194
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,620
      My father said that?!

195
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:50,589
      We have little time.

196
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,191
   You must come with us now.

197
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,693
      Let's go, Shane Gang!

198
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:55,927
         Junjie, you in?

199
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,129
     It would be my honor to
         accompany you.

200
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:01,032
    So...how do we get there?

201
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,942
            Eh... Uh?

202
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,811
           [whispers]

203
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:14,245
        What did he say?

204
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,213
           He said...

205
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,082
   "...This is going to hurt."

206
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:19,017
          Oh floppers.

207
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:24,756
            [yelling]

208
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:26,858
         Best day ever!

209
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,693
             [yells]

210
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:31,363
             [cheer]

211
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,068
              Huh?

212
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:47,345
            [screams]

213
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:50,348
            [groans]

214
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,350
            My brain.

215
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:53,818
            [groans]

216
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,820
       Ugh, my stomach is
           inside out!

217
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:56,988
            [groans]

218
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,823
        I have swallowed
            my brains

219
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,926
     and my stomachs are not
      digesting them well!

220
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:02,827
             Uh oh.

221
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,929
             [hurls]

222
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,698
             [chirp]

223
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,832
         Ugh, excuse me.

224
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:08,833
            [groans]

225
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:09,768
            You okay?

226
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,904
     I will be in a moment.

227
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:15,106
    No amount of training can
      prepare one for that!

228
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,676
     And, forgive my earlier
           shrieking.

229
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:20,145
           [whispers]

230
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:22,747
  Slugs are turning into ghouls
    all through the Caverns.

231
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,684
   So, what about my father's
            message?

232
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:28,253
            [chirps]

00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:30,021
            [grunts]

234
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,028
              Whoa.

235
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:07,826
            [chirps]

236
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,227
              Huh?

237
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,830
              Whoa!

238
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:12,330
            [grunts]

239
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:13,164
             A SLUG?

240
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:13,798
            [giggles]

241
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,100
           That's it?!

242
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:16,968
      It's an Enigmo slug!

243
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,237
    I thought we had the only
              one!

244
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,105
             [gasps]

245
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:27,512
            [chirps]

246
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:29,948
       That's so adorable!

247
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:30,515
           [sputters]

248
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,417
           I'm cuter.

249
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:44,863
    Enigmo slugs mess up your
 vision and make you see stuff.

250
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:47,165
    So why would my dad leave
           one for us?

251
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:48,299
           [whispers]

252
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,434
           Over there?

253
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,436
              Okay.

254
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,373
       Alright, now what?

255
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,976
          Oh floppers.

256
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,050
        We will leave you
         to the message

257
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:09,888
     and trust that it holds
    answers to our problems.

258
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:14,859
   Now we must go and do what
 we can to attend to the ghouls

259
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:17,395
     that plague the Caverns
           elsewhere.

260
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:18,129
            But wait!

261
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,531
          Aren't you...

262
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:20,865
              Huh?

263
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,001
            [chirps]

264
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:23,902
              Dad!?

265
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:28,873
    I hate to tell you this,
  but that is not your father.

266
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,376
        It is a hologram!

267
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:33,178
            Ohhhhhh.

268
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,345
         Thanks Pronto.

269
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:38,149
     Eli, I've recorded this
      message in the hopes

270
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:44,389
    By now you are the Shane,
 and I'm no longer here for you.

271
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:47,458
    I imagine we've had some
  amazing adventures together,

272
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,060
    and I'm sure that you've
          made me proud

273
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:51,062
 of the man that you've become.

274
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:53,565
By now I've taught you about all
 the different slugs that exist

275
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:55,400
       in the 99 Caverns--

276
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:59,337
   But there weren't always so
      many kinds of slugs.

277
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,073
    Long ago there were only
            the Five:

278
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:11,216
       Earth, Air, Energy,
        Water, and Fire.

279
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:15,086
   Every slug that exists came
   from these five Elementals.

280
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,388
   If anything were to happen
         to an Elemental

281
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:21,226
 something terrible would happen
 to all the slugs related to it.

282
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:24,095
   It has to be what happened
   to Bluster and the others!

283
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:26,865
   The Air Elemental must have
     been corrupted somehow!

284
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,399
 If you're seeing this message,

285
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:31,369
     something terrible has
        already occurred.

286
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,939
  Together, the five Elementals
     have incredible power.

287
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:37,876
     That's why they've been
scattered across the 99 caverns.

288
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:40,178
         You must gather
       the Five together.

289
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,647
 Only that will cure what damage
         has been done.

290
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:45,049
    I'm sorry I can't be here
        to help you, son.

291
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:48,286
 This map will lead you to where
      the Five are hidden.

292
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,555
    The map, as well as this
        recording of me,

293
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,057
        are stored within
        this Enigmo Slug.

294
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:56,361
     Sorry, but someone will
        have to slug you

295
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:57,996
         every time you
         want to use it.

296
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:02,367
  Ugh, the indignities we must
    endure to save our world!

297
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:05,003
  Only you can access the map,
              Eli,

298
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:08,139
   by supplying the answers to
   questions you and I share.

299
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,675
     Just say "Locate Earth
           Elemental"

300
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:13,011
       and I'll ask you a
       password question.

301
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:14,412
         Good luck, son.

302
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,013
              DAD!

303
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:16,014
              Wait!

304
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:17,482
            Ugh, Eli!

305
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:20,952
   For the last time, that was
        not your father!

306
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:24,122
     It was a mere hologram,
              okay?

307
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,290
            [chirps]

308
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:27,959
            [screams]

309
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,928
           Not again!

310
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,095
           Beeker! No!

311
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:34,032
      It's happening to all
        our water slugs!

312
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:35,967
           [growling]

313
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:38,436
     Whatever befell the Air
 Elemental must now be happening

314
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,305
     to the Water Elemental.

315
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:41,673
          We must hurry
        to that location,

316
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:44,242
    and stop this corruption
   before it spreads further.

317
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:48,046
    We're gonna fix this, and
  get our slugs back to normal.

318
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:50,014
    The map is tuned to you,
              Eli.

319
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,282
    Can you find the Cavern?

320
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,718
      Yeah, I can find it.

321
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,255
     Locate Water Elemental.

322
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,658
  You and I used to love racing
          down the hill

323
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,493
  during winters at the cabin.

324
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:05,129
        What was the name
          of our sled?

325
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,130
             Oh boy.

326
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:06,965
          Poopy-pants.

327
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,734
        My sled was named
          poopy-pants.

328
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:10,568
           [chuckles]

329
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,103
          Poppy-pants.

330
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:16,074
    Access granted, location:
        Undertow Cavern.

331
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:17,175
       That's real close.

332
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:18,676
           Saddle up!

333
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:28,353
        What has happened
         to this place?!

334
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:31,556
  If I were to guess, ghouling
the Elementals is wreaking havoc

335
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:34,092
      on the slug energy of
           the cavern.

336
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:35,994
            [grunts]

337
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:36,527
              Eli!

338
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,162
            DARKBANE!

339
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,064
          Oh floppers.

340
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,466
        This is not good.

341
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,301
       What are these guys
           doing here?

342
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:46,771
      They are here to obey
          my commands.

343
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:48,373
        (All): The Goon?!

344
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,241
      The Goon found a new
          host slinger!

345
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:52,310
        And he's working
       with the Darkbane?!

346
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:55,747
            [laughs]

347
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:58,449
        Goon's GOT to be
the one who took the Elementals!

348
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:01,019
    I do not know what those
          monsters are,

349
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:03,154
  but YOU I know all too well.

350
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:06,657
     And I know you better,
        little protector!

351
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,293
  I've lived inside your mind!

352
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:11,195
   And for that you will pay.

353
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,797
        Vengeance, Juju!

354
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:15,266
              Yeah!

355
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,201
        Bake him, Burpy!

356
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,054
     You fools are too late!

357
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:39,457
      We've ghouled the Air
 Elemental as well as the Water.

358
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:41,592
    When my associate returns
            with it,

359
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:45,129
       we will acquire the
        remaining three!

360
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:47,398
   Okay, nobody told me there
      was going to be math!

361
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:50,701
            [growls]

00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,437

            [growls]

364
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:57,175
Eli, we'll try and retrieve
       the Air Elemental.

365
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:59,644
  You need to find and recover
           the Water.

366
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:03,314
   Only problem, the map says
 the Elemental's on that island.

367
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,516
  And there's a lot of Darkbane
     between the sea and us.

368
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:07,285
    We can handle these guys,
              Eli.

369
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:10,855
      Kord, give me an exit
        to the shoreline.

370
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:11,856
            [chirps]

371
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:14,392
     One tunnel, comin' up!

372
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,766
            [grunts]

373
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,301
            Up to us
        to hold the fort.

374
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:24,502
         HOLD the fort?

375
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:28,206
       Pronto will deliver
  the Goon on a silver platter

376
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,508
        with a cave-apple
          in his mouth!

377
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,209
            [kisses]

378
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,679
            [screams]

379
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:37,515
     After, a short recess,
           of course.

380
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:48,593
 There is no way we're swimming
   across all that dark water.

381
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:49,460
            [chirps]

382
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,595
           Can you go
            Updraft??

383
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:52,296

             Woahh!

            [grunts]

387
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,743
          Ugh, I'm out!

388
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08,613
  Junjie, toss me a Hop Rock!!

389
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:16,454
 That was a piece-of-cake shot!

390
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,256
     The Goon was LINED UP!

391
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:19,757
   You did not guide the slug.

392
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,392
  With proper use of slug fu--

393
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:24,795
        Does it LOOK like
       I know slug fu!!??

394
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,267
 Your little tricks didn't help
 you save your Caverns, Junjie,

395
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,935
    and they won't help here.

396
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:32,770
          And you, Eli!

397
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,705
   I'll crush your Cavern too,

398
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:38,376
   after I twist your precious
     Elementals to my will.

399
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:40,378
     You know this is true.

400
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,679
         You've SEEN it!

401
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:42,647
              Wait.

402
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:44,749
          Where IS Eli?

403
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,621
 I think we should go in there!

404
00:19:57,462 --> 00:20:00,565
      Keep your eyes peeled
    for the Goon's associate.

405
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:03,401
   We'll have to take him down
   to get the Water Elemental.

406
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,644
          This place...

407
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:16,314
       It seems familiar.

408
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:19,250
             [gasps]

409
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:29,827
      He should be in here
           somewhere.

410
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,862
             [yells]

            [screams]

412
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,648
     Oh, he's here alright,

413
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,685
          and he makes
       such a fine ghoul.

414
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:55,419
            [laughs]

415
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:55,953
               No!

416
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:57,488
           Dr. Blakk!

417
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,756
        But, how did you?

418
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:04,395
   My trip to the deep caverns
        was invigorating.

            [grunts]

422
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,036
   Quite invigorating, indeed.

423
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:13,537
            [laughs]

424
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:17,275
      How long I've waited
        for this moment.

425
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:18,876
  Without The Elemental Slugs,

426
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:22,346
    The 99 Caverns will tear
        themselves apart.

427
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,490
       [panicked chirping]

429
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:34,892
               No!

430
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,598
           UGH!!!!!!!

431
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:47,071
            [grunts]

432
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:50,808
      As tempting as it is
       to finish this now,

433
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,778
       The Goon and I have
      bigger plans for you.

434
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,445
             AHHH!!!

435
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:57,748
    As we take The Elementals
           one by one,

436
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,418
     I want you to see that
       everything you love

437
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,753
        will turn to ash
       before your eyes...

438
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:06,691
    and you'll look back and
   wish it had all ended here.

439
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,629
              Huh?

440
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:14,699
           [laughter]

441
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:20,037
              Whoa!

442
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:23,607
        How does he know
      about The Elementals?

443
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,047
    Eli's been gone too long!

444
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,749
        I don't like it!

445
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:33,117
            [grunts]

446
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:38,489
 I am guessing that that cave-in
  has something to do with it!

447
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:40,925
     We gotta get over there
          and help him!

448
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:42,693
     Once we deal with that!

449
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,030
           Dr. Blakk?!

450
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,999
   And he appears to have been
          working out.

451
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:51,369
   Wait - Blakk and The Goon?

452
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:52,803
           Together!?

453
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:54,705
     You have the Elemental?

454
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,042
            [growls]

455
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,510
           Excellent.

456
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:00,644
         And the Shane?

457
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:02,446
  I can sense he's still alive!

458
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:03,881
   Why didn't you finish him?

459
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,117
   After all he's done to me?

460
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:08,652
      I want him to suffer.

461
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:11,655
     Ending him now would be
          too merciful.

462
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:15,626
   You should have ended this
    while you had the chance.

463
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:18,162
  Quick! To the next Elemental!

464
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:23,534
  Okay, now we can concentrate
       on helpin' out Eli!

465
00:23:23,536 --> 00:23:25,536
          Now Junjie...

466
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:28,072
          eh...Junjie?

467
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,917
             [grunt]

468
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,686
       I cannot allow you
  to leave here with that slug.

469
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:45,189
            [growls]

470
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:46,457
       [frightened chirp]

471
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:49,794
    Listen to me: you are not
            my enemy.

472
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:54,098
  The Goon controls your mind,
   as he once controlled mine.

473
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:58,569
       He cannot hear you,
        Eastern Champion.

474
00:23:58,571 --> 00:24:00,037
           But I can.

475
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:03,607
 I used to think I'd never find
     a host as good as you.

476
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,510
But this one is actually better.

477
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:07,945
          After all...

478
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:12,583
 what kind of slinger can't even
      save his home cavern?

479
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,654
        [fighting grunts]

480
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,232
       So, uh... any ideas
      on how to get to Eli?

481
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:30,000
              Whoa!

482
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:31,569
            [grunts]

483
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:34,205
     Blakk is back, somehow.

484
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:35,940
  He's got The Water Elemental

485
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:37,875
       and he'll be going
         after the rest.

486
00:24:37,877 --> 00:24:39,176
           We saw him!

487
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:40,978
   He's working with the Goon.

488
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,048
         Who has escaped
       with the Elemental.

489
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,116
        Then we gotta get
     to the next one first.

490
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:48,619
            [chirps]

491
00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:49,720
     Ready to open that map?

492
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,055
            [chirps]

493
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:53,524
  Uh, Pronto volunteers himself
       to fire The Enigmo.

494
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:57,161
    No need to get slugged if
      you can avoid it, eh?

495
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,162
           [chuckles]

496
00:24:58,164 --> 00:24:59,196
          Uh, Junjie -

497
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:01,232
 what happened back there, bro?

498
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:05,002
    You do realize you bailed
  and left Eli trapped, right?

499
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,238
      The Goon was escaping
       with the Elemental.

500
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,907
   I trusted Eli could handle
           himself --

501
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:11,809
          which he did.

502
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:12,943
           I'm ready.

503
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:14,879
         Let's do this.

504
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:18,215
    What if this is how Blakk
         is beating us?

505
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:21,118
   You said yourself The Goon
      can get in your head.

506
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,154
    What if he's stealing the
  Elemental locations from you?

507
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:26,624
       I do not think so.

508
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:28,726
     Consider that The Goon
  obtained the first elemental

509
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:31,595
     before your Shadow-clan
  even told us about The Five.

510
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:32,796
       June's right, Trix.

511
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:34,665
    Besides, it doesn't work
            that way.

512
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:35,799
        It's more like...

513
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:36,901
             a scar.

514
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:39,236
       A reminder of what
          he did to us.

515
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:41,939
             Do it.

516
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:43,007
           [laughter]

517
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:44,909
       Better you than me!

518
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,947
            [grunts]

519
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:51,982
    Eli, if you're listening
            to this,

520
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:54,952
       it's time to unlock
       the next of the 5.

521
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:56,687
   So Blakk has Air and Water,

522
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:59,957
   which leaves us with Earth,
        Fire and Energy.

523
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:01,692
    "Locate Earth Elemental."

524
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:03,761
              Done.

525
00:26:03,763 --> 00:26:05,296
  Which were the only teammates
             of mine

526
00:26:05,298 --> 00:26:07,998
  I ever brought to the surface
          to meet you?

527
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,133
             Hmmmm.

528
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:10,968
What about your Dad's tracker...

529
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,069
            Tom Por?

530
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,237
          I don't know.

531
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,939
        Dad never brought
          anyone home.

532
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:17,007
            [chirps]

533
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:18,108
            Unless...

534
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,677
     It's your slugs, right?

535
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,312
    You always said they were
      a slinger's teammates

536
00:26:21,314 --> 00:26:22,346
       as much as anyone.

537
00:26:22,348 --> 00:26:23,681
            [chirps]

538
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:25,282
           Well done.

539
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:27,952
              Hey.

540
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:29,820
   That's Quartermain Cavern.

541
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:31,822
      Well then that makes
          this simple!

542
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:35,225
  I know quite a few shortcuts
 that can get us there quickly.

543
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:37,061
 Then what are we still standing
        around here for?

544
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:37,962
            Let's go!

545
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:39,930
        Just a sec, guys.

546
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,832
    Trixie mentioned Tom Por.

547
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:44,234
      I know you and he had
 your differences over the years

548
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:45,836
           but he was
        a good teammate.

549
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:47,104
      How did you two keep
           it together

550
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,872
     when you didn't always
           get along?

551
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:50,874
    I'm not your father, Eli.

552
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:53,611
    I'm a heuristic recording
    based on a limited number

553
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:55,379
  of pre-programmed responses.

554
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:57,281
 Pronto I keep telling him that,
           Mr. Shane,

555
00:26:57,283 --> 00:27:00,084
 but he just won't listen to me!

556
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:02,252
    You know what he's like,
             right?

557
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:05,956
    All I can tell you is...
      trust your instincts.

558
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,691
   You'll figure it out, Eli.

559
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:09,159
           I promise.

560
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:11,195
      To Quartermain then.

561
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,101
       So much for simple.

562
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:18,969
       By ghouling two of
         the Elementals,

563
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,671
 Blakk and the Goon have ghouled

564
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:23,073
      almost half the slugs
          in Slugterra.

565
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:26,010
 It's a miracle we haven't seen
 even more damage than we have.

566
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:28,746
  I just hope the other caverns
        are doing better

567
00:27:28,748 --> 00:27:30,381
        than this place.

568
00:27:30,383 --> 00:27:33,751
    Eh...so...what do we do?

569
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:35,352
      Only one thing to do.

570
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:37,955
        Close your eyes,
        hold your nose...

571
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:39,890
          ...and jump!

572
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,359
   That is considered a plan?

573
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:43,327
             "Jump?"

574
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,294
           Yeah it is!

575
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:45,896
         He-he-he-whoo!

576
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:47,798
            [grunts]

577
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,700
   Uh, heh, surely there must
         be another way

578
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:51,869
   that involves getting a bit
            less mud

579
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:54,304
 on my luxurious, Molenoid coat!

580
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:57,374
    Actually, friend Pronto,
            there is.

581
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:59,877
            [giggles]

            [yelling]

583
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,183
         This is great!

584
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:11,722
           [cheering]

585
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:13,257
    Wait a minute -- Junjie!

586
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:15,459
  Where are Pronto and Junjie?

587
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:22,900
              Oooh!

588
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:24,001
            Whoooaa!

589
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:28,472
          Kowabalooga!

590
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:30,741
      All it takes is your
        Geoshard slug --

591
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:32,910
        and a fair degree
           of balance.

592
00:28:32,912 --> 00:28:34,178
       Well you heard him,
              guys!

593
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,313

           WHOOO-HAHA!

597
00:28:49,128 --> 00:28:50,828
            [laughs]

598
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:55,065
      This is haunted, bro!

599
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:57,234
             HA-HA!

600
00:28:58,204 --> 00:29:02,206
 Hey, look at me! I am so epic.

601
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:05,876
     Probably the most epic
        surfer who ever-

602
00:29:05,878 --> 00:29:06,210
             Gah --

603
00:29:06,212 --> 00:29:07,144
             WHAAA!

604
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:07,778
             Whoa!!

00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,245

           We did it!

613
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:24,194
              Nice!

614
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,867
            Easy now.

615
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:31,802
   I've got you, Little Lord.

616
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:34,972
           He missed!

617
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:36,240
           I'm on it!

00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:55,159
            Eeeeeee!

624
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:56,326
          I've got you,
           little guy!

625
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:58,996
       Oh no -- look out!!

626
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:00,364
              Huh?

627
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:03,901
       BRACE FOR IMPACT!!

628
00:30:03,903 --> 00:30:05,302
           WHOA!!!!!!

629
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,503
         Hang on, guys!

630
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,944
        AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!

631
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,348
             [gasps]

632
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,284
       [nervous laughter]

633
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:21,585
              Eli!

634
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:23,220
        [panicked chirps]

635
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,126
    We have to seal that up!

636
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,239
  Well, it wasn't exactly easy,

637
00:30:42,241 --> 00:30:44,041
      but at least we have
      the Earth Elemental.

638
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:47,578
   if your slug hadn't knocked
        mine off course!

639
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,012
           Off course?

640
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,581
 Your slug missed the Elemental!

641
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:52,182
    I was bringing it around,

642
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,251
 so it could push the Elemental
           towards me.

643
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:56,420
    I was in complete control
           of my slug.

644
00:30:56,422 --> 00:30:58,155
      That is a basic part
         of my training.

645
00:30:58,157 --> 00:31:03,026
        So you're saying,
  you had it all under control?

646
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,928
              YES.

647
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:05,963
             [groan]

648
00:31:05,965 --> 00:31:07,364
    You gotta admit, Trix...

649
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,566
     his slug-foo is, hm...

650
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,934
          pretty cool.

651
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:11,635
              Uhh.

652
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:13,270
       Not to be a bummer.

653
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:17,107
  But I don't think those webs
      can hold much longer!

654
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:18,008
            [grunts]

655
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:21,578
     that can get us through
     a million tons of mud!

656
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,146
            [chirps]

657
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:24,381
      The Earth Elemental!

658
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,917
   Looks like he's got an idea
         to get us out.

659
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:28,318
      That is unadvisable.

660
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,387
    It would be more prudent
     not to use the new slug

661
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:33,056
     until you have had time
      to properly train it.

662
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:36,059
    that's not really the way
         I do things...

663
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,628
       I trust the slugs.

664
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,632
      Besides its not like
      we've got any choice!

665
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,378
          Uhh... guys!

666
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:58,482
          Aw, floppers.

667
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:09,393
        [sighs of relief]

668
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:10,294
              Yes!

669
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:12,696
            [cheers]

670
00:32:12,698 --> 00:32:14,164
        That was awesome!

671
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:15,465
            [chirps]

672
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:17,267
   Now let's get out of here.

673
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:20,370
   are probably already headed
    to the next Elemental...

674
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,476
           [grunting]

675
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:31,481
           [screaming]

676
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:33,450
 I'm telling you it's not here.

677
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,686
      And that is my fault?

678
00:32:35,688 --> 00:32:39,289
    We should have gone after
       The Earth Elemental

679
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:44,394
You honestly think I'd listen to
   a monster such as yourself?

680
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:46,496
    You sound as if you don't
            trust me!

681
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:47,431
            Should I?

682
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:48,632
        Of course not!!!

683
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:51,168
     Alright, knock it off!

684
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,703
   I don't know what's worse;

685
00:32:52,705 --> 00:32:56,306
     you two bickering like
        married Molenoids

686
00:32:56,308 --> 00:33:00,077
 or the fact that you're tearing
         my town apart!

687
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:02,512
     Redhook, you daft twit!

688
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:03,347
             [gasps]

689
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:07,084
      Nobody calls me daft!

690
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:09,553
             Uh oh.

691
00:33:09,555 --> 00:33:11,989
            [Strains]

692
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:13,991
       What's up with you,
             Blakk?

693
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:16,393
      You got bad allergies
          or something?

694
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:18,695
  You're all bloated and puffy.

695
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:20,664
      The Energy Elemental.

696
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,532
          Where is it?

697
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:25,002
  That's just a stupid legend,

698
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:28,305
     like the Burning World
      or odorless plumbing!

00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:29,406
            [grunts]

700
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:32,042
      Tell me where it is!

701
00:33:32,044 --> 00:33:33,176
      What do I look like?

702
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,211
         A mind-reader?

703
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:35,545
               No.

704
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:37,581
            But I am.

705
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,183
           [stutters]
              Hey!

706
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:43,653
Quit messin' with my noodle box,
            ya snoop!

707
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:45,655
 Ooh... he's speaking the truth.

708
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:48,258
   The only thing that's going
      on in that daft brain

709
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,061
  is a recipe for hot sauce and
    some plans to watch a...

710
00:33:51,063 --> 00:33:52,329
         terrible movie.

             [gasps]

712
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,398
           Terrible?!

713
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,334
       Max Jackson's 2000
         Furious Punches

714
00:33:57,336 --> 00:33:59,636
   is the best floppin' movie
           ever made!!

715
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:01,471
     What movie do you like?

716
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:03,607
    Kisses From A Hoverbug?!

717
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:06,076
            [kissing]

718
00:34:06,078 --> 00:34:08,045
    We're wasting time here.

719
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:09,579
        We must hurry to
       the next Elemental,

720
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:10,647
   and hope that we figure out

721
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:14,217
     where this Energy slug
          is en route!

722
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,185
             [snarl]

723
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:17,220
    We're running in circles!

724
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,456
      What if you're wrong
    about the next one too?!

725
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:24,227
  What if the Shane Gang finds
 the Energy Elemental before us?

726
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:28,131
       If I can't find it,
       they won't either.

727
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:31,668
  Their intel can't possibly be
        as good as mine.

728
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,604
    Once we have the others,
          and we will,

729
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:38,675
  the Energy Elemental will be
          easy to find.

             [growl]

731
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:42,813
     We'll play it your way,
              Slug.

732
00:34:42,815 --> 00:34:44,181
            For now.

733
00:34:44,183 --> 00:34:45,382
          But for you?

734
00:34:45,384 --> 00:34:46,650
           [chuckles]

735
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:50,153
        We get to play...
             my way.

750
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:27,724
        I'm just saying,
       because of Junjie,

751
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:30,560
  we were that close to losing
      the Earth Elemental.

752
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:32,429
 It's not his fault or anything.

753
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:36,133
   He's just too used to being
         a solo slinger!

754
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:37,868
       Okay gang, we have
        the coordinates.

755
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:40,437
        We're heading for
       Quiet Lawn cavern.

756
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:43,907
    Maybe Redhook can help me
        with this thing.

757
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:45,709
       Oh... what is that?

758
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:48,345
    Well I noticed The Earth
       Elemental gives off

759
00:35:48,347 --> 00:35:49,846
   a unique energy signature.

760
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:52,616
  So I'm thinking if the others
    have similar properties,

761
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:55,252
  I might be able to calibrate
          our blasters

762
00:35:55,254 --> 00:35:56,820
       to pick up on it...

763
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:59,189
             maybe.

00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:04,594
           Yeah, see?

767
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:06,263
       Something's wrong.

768
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:09,166
  I keep reading two Elementals
       in Eli's backpack.

769
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:11,334
      I would try reversing
  the polarity, if I were you.

770
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,636
       Yeah. I tried that.

771
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:13,670
          I don't know.

772
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:14,738
     Probably the batteries.

773
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,741
   I'll charge it as we ride.

774
00:36:17,743 --> 00:36:18,508
            Alright.

775
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,510
        We're moving out!

776
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:36,193
   How do they keep beating us
         to the punch?!

777
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:37,360
     They must have trashed
           the Cavern

778
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,362
  to find the Energy Elemental.

779
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:40,297
         We're too late!

780
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:44,334
   None of our slugs that are
 related to the Energy Elemental

781
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:45,869
       have been ghouled.

782
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,370
  Are the batteries recharged?

783
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,405
              Argh.

784
00:36:48,407 --> 00:36:50,207
         Two signatures.

785
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:51,341
            But why?

786
00:36:51,343 --> 00:36:53,410
         We've only got
      the Earth Elemental!

787
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:55,212
     We can worry about that
            later --

788
00:36:55,214 --> 00:36:57,480
      there are people here
         who need help!

789
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,283
              Huh?

790
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:07,724
            Redhook!

791
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:12,596
            [grunts]

792
00:37:12,598 --> 00:37:14,497
     I think he's hurt bad,
              bro!

793
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:16,499
            [grunts]

794
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:19,369
             [cough]

795
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:20,370
            Blakk...

796
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:22,339
         stormed in with
          The Darkbane,

797
00:37:22,341 --> 00:37:24,841
looking for an Energy Elemental.

798
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:28,345
        Trashed the place
    when he didn't find it...

799
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:31,481
We've got a real pressure-cooker
              here!

800
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:33,817
     We're going to get you
          out of there.

801
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:35,919
   Hurry! Get this off of him!

802
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:39,889
            [belches]

803
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:55,905
   Once again, it seems I owe
    a Shane all that I have.

804
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:57,407
        But I'm afraid...

805
00:37:57,409 --> 00:38:02,412
     I won't have the chance
        to repay you ...

806
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:04,347
     I think it is too late.

807
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:05,548
          Not for Doc!

808
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,716
        You can do this!

809
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:08,618
         I know you can.

810
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,295
              Eh...

811
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,433
     [laboured gasp for air]

812
00:38:23,435 --> 00:38:25,769
            [cheers]

813
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:26,770
            Woo-hoo!!

814
00:38:26,772 --> 00:38:28,338
       Hooray for Pronto!!

815
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,372
              Hey?!

816
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:30,373
           [chuckles]

817
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:32,042
     Uh, c'mon! Am I right?

818
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:33,877
      That is quite a slug.

819
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:34,878
         He's a healer!

820
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,379
     A guardian one at that!

821
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:37,380
               No.

822
00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:39,382
   I have seen healers before.

823
00:38:39,384 --> 00:38:42,752
  That... is something special.

824
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:44,854
   WHOA-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA-W-WAIT
            A MINUTE!

825
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:46,923
      I thought this thing
         wasn't working

826
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:49,793
     because it was reading
  two Elementals in your pack!

827
00:38:49,795 --> 00:38:53,630
    And look - the other one
     it was reading was Doc!

828
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:54,631
           What if...

829
00:38:54,633 --> 00:38:56,599
  Doc is the Energy Elemental?!

830
00:38:56,601 --> 00:39:02,072
  The Hooligang probably found
 him here before you two dueled.

831
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:03,473
             [gasp]

832
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:05,442
            [chirps]

833
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:09,512
   Not to rush things but I am
  sure the cavern will be safe

834
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:12,482
          in Redhook's
         capable hands.

835
00:39:12,484 --> 00:39:12,849
              Uh...

836
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:13,683
             hand...

837
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,385
        I... uh... hook.

838
00:39:15,387 --> 00:39:17,387
    Gah - but, there is still
          one Elemental

839
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:19,656
   we have not accounted for!

840
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:21,057
       The Fire Elemental!

841
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:22,492
         We gotta hurry.

842
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:24,060
           Let's move!

843
00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:25,862
             [chirp]

844
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,699
         Upright Cavern.

845
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,067
  According to Dad's hologram,

846
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:34,003
  The Fire Elemental should be
           at the top!

847
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:37,607
   There is no way our mechas
     can make it up there...

848
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:41,378
    No, but I know what can:
            jetpacks!

849
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,946
      Which we do not have.

850
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:44,781
       Eli and I will use
         Burpy and Juju

851
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:46,850
 to retrieve the Fire Elemental.

852
00:39:53,592 --> 00:39:56,393
   You're pretty good at that,
            Junjie...

853
00:39:56,395 --> 00:39:59,396
    Well, I have been flying
  my Infernus since I was five.

854
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:00,397
             Really?

855
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:01,631
           I sorta...

856
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:03,733
      just figured it out.

857
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:13,042
    You're gonna fly up there
        without us, bro?

858
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:15,145
       You're really gonna
          choose him --

859
00:40:15,147 --> 00:40:16,646
            over us?

860
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:19,149
   Us? Aren't the five of us,
              "us?"

861
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:21,718
     It's not that Junjie's
          not talented.

862
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,886
         Or even nice...

863
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:24,587
       Uh, but then again,

864
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:27,190
     Twist seemed very nice
       when he joined us.

865
00:40:27,192 --> 00:40:29,058
       You know, at first.

866
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,794
 This isn't anything like that.

867
00:40:30,796 --> 00:40:34,564
Sure, we had some growing pains,
       but we need Junjie.

868
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:35,665
         I'm sure of it.

869
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:38,067
       As much as we need
           each other.

             [grunt]

872
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:46,943
    Well, I guess he chose...

873
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,783
      I'd like to see Blakk
         get here first!

874
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:56,519
       After all, it's not
     like Darkbane can fly!

875
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:58,188
           Eli, look!

876
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,923
              Whoa!

877
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:00,857
           We did it!

878
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:03,059
          There he is!

879
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:04,928
           Hey there!

880
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:07,530
  I'm Eli and this is my friend
             Burpy!

00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:08,631

          Easy, Burpy!

885
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:17,874
     It appears the Darkbane
            can fly.

886
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:19,609
              Move!

00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:27,550

    the eels, not the riders!

               NO!

921
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:06,082
      Do not worry Junjie!

922
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,350
        I will save yoo-

923
00:43:07,352 --> 00:43:08,084
              OOF!

925
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:10,954
       Great catch, Kord!

926
00:43:10,956 --> 00:43:12,689
  They got the fire elemental.

927
00:43:12,691 --> 00:43:17,827
   when all of our fire slugs
     suddenly turned ghoul!

928
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:19,963
       We need to get Juju
         and Burpy back!

929
00:43:19,965 --> 00:43:22,131
       But it's not going

932
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:29,906
     There, we can lose them
         in the tunnel!

00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:37,046

960
00:45:27,992 --> 00:45:30,727
         Well, that's it
        for the Jetpacks.

961
00:45:30,729 --> 00:45:33,396
      Pronto, have we been
          here before?

962
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:34,397
               Hmm

963
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,966
           [muttering]

964
00:45:36,968 --> 00:45:38,868
       Ah! Yes, of course!

965
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:40,803
    Accounting for the height
      from which we fell -

966
00:45:40,805 --> 00:45:42,438
     and the various twists
         in the tunnels,

967
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,208
     I would calculate that
    we have landed precisely

968
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,476
    in the neighborhood of--

969
00:45:46,478 --> 00:45:48,811
   We're in the Jungle Cavern.

970
00:45:48,813 --> 00:45:51,114
    Err, In The Jungle Cavern

971
00:45:51,116 --> 00:45:53,149
     But it's been Ghouled.

972
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:57,887
     Another cavern lost to
     the ghouled elementals.

973
00:45:57,889 --> 00:46:00,256
 This is what's going to happen
       to all of Slugterra

974
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:02,959
      if Blakk and Goon get
     all five elementals...

975
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:09,031
             [cries]

976
00:46:09,033 --> 00:46:10,399
     They will break through
       the clog in moments

977
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:12,835
   We must escape, and protect
     the elementals we have.

978
00:46:12,837 --> 00:46:15,538
   No! We can't keep running,
             Junjie.

979
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:18,407
    Like my dad said, getting
  the five elementals unghouled

980
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:21,043
        is the only thing
    that can save Slugterra.

981
00:46:21,045 --> 00:46:23,045
   We have to fight them NOW.

982
00:46:23,047 --> 00:46:25,948
      We cannot risk losing
       the elementals Eli.

983
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,416
        But we have Doc.

984
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:29,252
      The energy elemental
          is the key...

985
00:46:29,254 --> 00:46:29,986
          [proud chirp]

986
00:46:29,988 --> 00:46:32,455
       If we can shoot Doc
     at Blakk's elementals,

987
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:33,990
             we win!

988
00:46:33,992 --> 00:46:36,926
     If you miss, the energy
   elemental will be Blakk's,

989
00:46:36,928 --> 00:46:39,796
        and the world as
       we know it is lost.

            [growls]

992
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,144
   Why didn't we just do away
            with Eli

993
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:57,480
    while we had our chance?

994
00:46:57,482 --> 00:47:00,416
 He has the last two elementals.

995
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:02,451
     We need only take them
            from him,

996
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:04,353
    and our plan is complete!

997
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:07,423
    Eliminating Eli gives us
        the same result!

998
00:47:07,425 --> 00:47:08,925
  Slugterra would no longer be

999
00:47:08,927 --> 00:47:11,194
      under the protection
          of the Shane.

1000
00:47:11,196 --> 00:47:13,863
       We would already be
            in power!

1001
00:47:13,865 --> 00:47:16,332
       Let me be clear...

1002
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:20,136
     Eli stays alive to see
       our total victory.

1003
00:47:20,138 --> 00:47:22,171
       We do as we agreed!

1004
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:32,615
        Here, they come!

   The shot must be perfect...

00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:11,153
   Do not take it if there is
      any chance of a miss!

 Slugterra is literally sinking

   Getting the five elementals

 Junjie, I need you to take him
 off his eel and keep him still

1069
00:50:54,352 --> 00:50:56,085
       so I can blast him
            with Doc

00:50:56,087 --> 00:50:58,054
     and cure the remaining

      the Goon's got one...

          which means--

   I told Junjie to stop Blakk
        from reaching Eli

1148
00:54:38,476 --> 00:54:41,043
   because Blakk doesn't have
       all the Elementals.

      you did exactly what
        the team needed.

        Eli was right...

        looking for it --

1162

          to be found!

1163
00:55:18,516 --> 00:55:20,416
      How did you even know
         where to look?

           don't you?

1173
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:48,110
     Yeah, well I prefer not
      to think about it...

           You've got
     the energy elemental...

1225
00:57:50,701 --> 00:57:52,067
         Say hello, Doc!

            [chirps]

1227
00:57:53,871 --> 00:57:55,003
       Well come on then!

1228
00:57:55,005 --> 00:57:56,505
      We can't waste time!

1229
00:57:56,507 --> 00:57:58,073
        We can catch him
          by surprise!

1230
00:57:58,075 --> 00:58:00,642
     You heard him! Come on!

1231
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:02,044
            Aggghhh!

1232
00:58:02,046 --> 00:58:03,111
          It's no use!

1233
00:58:03,113 --> 00:58:05,681
        You are mine now.

            [grunts]

1235
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:07,816
             You...

1236
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:08,784
            can't...

1237
00:58:08,786 --> 00:58:11,854
           NOOooooo...

1238
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:19,728
     Now, let's finish this!

1239
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:20,929
            Regroup!

1240
00:58:20,931 --> 00:58:22,798
     Keep your eyes peeled!

1241
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,067
   They can't have gone far...

1242
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:26,902
         We're too late!

1243
00:58:26,904 --> 00:58:28,937
 We've got to try the same thing
          as before...

1244
00:58:28,939 --> 00:58:30,172
          Lure him into
        the line of fire,

1245
00:58:30,174 --> 00:58:32,241
  so I can shoot him with Doc.

1246
00:58:32,243 --> 00:58:34,676
      And this time around,
      we've got two Shanes.

1247
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:35,777
           Right, Dad?

1248
00:58:35,779 --> 00:58:37,613
          Let's do it!

1249
00:58:37,615 --> 00:58:40,816
      Will Shane just said
         "Let's do it!"

1251
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:47,756
     So here's what we need
            to do...

    You can take position at
 the other side of the sinkhole!

1264
00:59:32,136 --> 00:59:35,938
It seems I've spent so much time
    in your mind, Will Shane,

1265
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:39,341
      that I can anticipate
           your moves.

1266
00:59:39,343 --> 00:59:40,943
           We'll see.

         [deep breaths]

            Now Eli!

        Great shot, Eli!

1282
01:00:41,705 --> 01:00:44,106
         Thanks Dad, did
        we get them all?

1283
01:00:44,108 --> 01:00:47,409
      But to save Slugterra
     and reverse the damage,

1284
01:00:47,411 --> 01:00:50,846
        we need to sling
      them simultaneously.

1285

      I've met you before!

1286

       It's Pinto, right?!

1287
01:00:54,718 --> 01:00:56,685
          Bah! Pinto!?

1288
01:00:56,687 --> 01:00:58,787
      Pinto is my identical
          twin brother!

   I'd rather let you shrivel
           and writhe,

1291
01:01:04,128 --> 01:01:06,428
    but we have a job to do.

         Let's do this!

1295
01:01:15,773 --> 01:01:17,773
             Shoot!

           No no Dad!!

             Eli no!

     do not fail this world
   as I did mine, please Eli,

      it's what your father
      would want you to do.

        It is your duty!
