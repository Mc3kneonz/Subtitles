00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.316
<i>Cybertron.</i>

2
00:00:05.351 --> 00:00:08.053
<i>My name is Bumblebee, and
I keep the peace around here.</i>

3
00:00:08.087 --> 00:00:10.422
<i>Try to, anyway.</i>

4
00:00:10.456 --> 00:00:12.390
<i>We have a 2-1-1 in progress.</i>

5
00:00:23.035 --> 00:00:25.003
Get it in gear, Cadet Strongarm.

6
00:00:25.037 --> 00:00:27.539
Whatever we're doing, I am honored.

7
00:00:27.573 --> 00:00:31.309
After all, you were there,
right alongside Optimus Prime.

8
00:00:31.843 --> 00:00:33.283
But...?

9
00:00:33.318 --> 00:00:37.248
It's just, after all you and
Optimus did for Cybertron,

10
00:00:37.316 --> 00:00:40.351
I'm surprised you weren't
made something more...

11
00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:43.354
prestigious than a street cop.

12
00:00:46.425 --> 00:00:48.593
<i>That has to be our disturbance.</i>

13
00:01:06.145 --> 00:01:10.148
In front of the Optimus statue!

14
00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.554
- That punk is going down.
- That punk is Sideswipe,

15
00:01:16.589 --> 00:01:19.090
and while he's about as
exciting as this job gets,

16
00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:22.427
he's not actually dangerous.
I'll just...

17
00:01:35.875 --> 00:01:41.172
- Sir? What is it?
- D-Do you see that?

18
00:01:45.351 --> 00:01:49.787
That's okay, Lieutenant, you meditate.
I'll handle this perp.

19
00:01:55.227 --> 00:01:56.528
Optimus?

20
00:02:05.738 --> 00:02:07.238
<i>Earth?</i>

21
00:02:10.743 --> 00:02:13.611
Stop, or I'll...

22
00:02:13.646 --> 00:02:16.714
<i>Eat my exhaust? Whoo!</i>

23
00:02:21.487 --> 00:02:25.623
- Whoo! All right! Ha, ha, yeah!
- Pull over!

24
00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:34.532
Oof.

25
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.673
W-What?
You crazy?

26
00:02:45.311 --> 00:02:46.811
Optimus Prime!

27
00:02:48.647 --> 00:02:50.215
Lieutenant!

29
00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.123
No!

30
00:03:25.568 --> 00:03:27.469
Optimus...

31
00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:33.608
Lieutenant, are you talking
to the statue's head?

32
00:03:36.078 --> 00:03:38.991
Brain rust.

33
00:03:38.992 --> 00:03:42.117
- So sad.
- Show some respect!

34
00:03:42.151 --> 00:03:46.287
You can't turn left on Cybertron
without breaking some law.

35
00:03:46.322 --> 00:03:50.091
Cadet Strongarm, take Sideswipe
down to the station for processing.

36
00:03:50.126 --> 00:03:53.028
- Seriously?
- Sir, ride-along regulation

37
00:03:53.062 --> 00:03:55.263
201, section 4, requires that I...

38
00:03:55.297 --> 00:03:58.017
<i>Uh, I'll meet you there.</i>

39
00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.768
Good plan, sir.

40
00:04:30.966 --> 00:04:32.067
Wha...?

41
00:04:32.101 --> 00:04:36.504
- Rusty!
- It's Russell.

42
00:04:36.572 --> 00:04:41.376
Come on, son.
You're not that grown up. Not yet.

43
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.712
Hey, we're going to
have a blast and a half

44
00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.250
- while you're mom's away working in...
- Copenhagen?

45
00:04:49.318 --> 00:04:54.489
You know, a real city?
Like the one across the river?

46
00:04:54.523 --> 00:04:57.092
I never get into Crown City.

47
00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:02.664
I... We have everything
we need right here.

48
00:05:06.368 --> 00:05:11.106
- Except excitement.
- Aw, Rust... Russell.

49
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.776
I still have a lot of the stuff
you used to love playing with.

50
00:05:14.844 --> 00:05:17.112
Because you won't sell anything.

51
00:05:17.146 --> 00:05:21.516
And check this out.
It's the 14th Street Diner.

52
00:05:21.584 --> 00:05:25.520
They were gonna tear it down,
so I had it moved here piece by piece.

53
00:05:25.588 --> 00:05:27.255
Isn't it awesome?

54
00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.525
It's kinda weird.
Like living in a scrap yard.

55
00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:36.820
Please. Vintage salvage depot
for the discriminating nostalgist.

56
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.639
W-Was that an earthquake?

57
00:05:50.646 --> 00:05:54.616
<i>Uhh.
May-d-d-day.</i>

58
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.519
M-Mayday.

59
00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:06.127
Welcome to the Cybertron History Museum.

60
00:06:06.162 --> 00:06:08.863
- Do you need a map?
- No, thank you.

61
00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:28.216
A Space Bridge.

62
00:06:32.221 --> 00:06:34.255
Are these Earth coordinates?

63
00:06:36.792 --> 00:06:40.895
<i>Bumblebee.
I knew you would understand.</i>

64
00:06:43.666 --> 00:06:48.369
Optimus? Is it really you?
Where are you?

65
00:06:48.404 --> 00:06:50.772
<i>I need you on Earth, Bumblebee.</i>

66
00:06:50.806 --> 00:06:54.242
<i>A new mission. A dire threat.</i>

67
00:06:54.276 --> 00:06:55.677
Me?

68
00:06:55.711 --> 00:06:59.514
<i>Go there, and we shall speak again.</i>

69
00:06:59.548 --> 00:07:02.483
- Can't you tell me...
- Lieutenant?

70
00:07:04.653 --> 00:07:09.691
Please take me to jail!
This place is so much worse.

71
00:07:09.725 --> 00:07:13.494
- Strongarm, I told you to...
- With all due respect, sir,

72
00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:18.499
regulation 201, section 4:
a ride-along shall accompany

73
00:07:24.541 --> 00:07:27.776
Okay.
I've been following a trail.

74
00:07:27.811 --> 00:07:31.947
One that you two apparently can't see.
A trail laid out for me by...

75
00:07:32.505 --> 00:07:34.049
Optimus Prime.

76
00:07:34.117 --> 00:07:39.655
- The Optimus Prime?
- Who is no longer alive?

77
00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:44.493
Optimus Prime wants to send
us to Earth? I am so, so in!

78
00:07:44.527 --> 00:07:49.631
No, you're out.
It's a mission for me. Alone.

79
00:07:59.008 --> 00:08:00.909
Ah, guards.

80
00:08:02.679 --> 00:08:05.013
I'll keep them busy.
Please see if there's a way

81
00:08:05.048 --> 00:08:07.716
to disable those stasis
fields around the Space Bridge.

82
00:08:07.751 --> 00:08:09.651
Tampering with museum property?

83
00:08:09.686 --> 00:08:14.089
Sir, you know that violates
Protocol Section 116, Paragraph...

84
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.462
He's Bumblebee.
He must have a good reason, right?

85
00:08:20.497 --> 00:08:23.048
You're a punk.
You know how to take out

86
00:08:23.049 --> 00:08:25.534
- security systems, don't you?
- No!

87
00:08:26.836 --> 00:08:28.158
Maybe.

88
00:08:28.972 --> 00:08:32.441
Experts say the tremor downtown
Crown City just experienced

89
00:08:32.475 --> 00:08:34.877
was from a low-level sonic
boom just across the river.

90
00:08:34.911 --> 00:08:37.112
Scientists suspect
a meteor might have finished

91
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.716
burning up while passing
through Earth's atmosphere.

92
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:44.753
Meteor?
Exploration time.

93
00:08:44.821 --> 00:08:46.789
You mean "wander through the woods

94
00:08:46.856 --> 00:08:50.159
looking for a sliver of rock
that probably isn't there" time?

95
00:08:51.861 --> 00:08:55.097
We'll have to go treasure hunting later.
That's my 9:00 a.m.

96
00:08:55.131 --> 00:08:58.801
He wants to sell a full
set of life-size aluminum

97
00:08:58.868 --> 00:09:02.004
Billy the Breakfast Beaver figures.

98
00:09:03.473 --> 00:09:06.108
Wanna help your old man close the deal?

99
00:09:06.176 --> 00:09:09.711
Uh, why don't I go see
if I can find that meteor?

100
00:09:09.746 --> 00:09:13.916
Divide and conquer.
Great plan.

101
00:09:24.027 --> 00:09:27.429
Okay, stay calm, speak clearly.

102
00:09:28.798 --> 00:09:31.400
Mayday.
Mayday, Cybertron Control.

103
00:09:31.434 --> 00:09:34.169
If you can hear me,
this is maximum security

104
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.606
prison ship Alchemor.
We have crashed on an unknown planet.

105
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.175
Many of the containment
pods were disengaged,

106
00:09:40.243 --> 00:09:42.678
but the one I can see
still appears to be intact,

107
00:09:42.712 --> 00:09:46.448
so I'm hopeful none
of the prisoners has...

108
00:09:46.483 --> 00:09:51.019
Uh, Control?
Updating that last report...

109
00:09:51.054 --> 00:09:57.826
- Hey, all clear back there.
- Wait, aren't you... Bumblebee?

110
00:09:57.861 --> 00:10:00.929
- You're working here now?
- Yeah, just started today.

111
00:10:00.964 --> 00:10:04.566
- No, disable that relay.
- Don't touch!

112
00:10:04.601 --> 00:10:08.604
- You guys are the real heroes.
- What's going on?

113
00:10:15.545 --> 00:10:17.846
Intruder doing a bad
impersonation of Bumblebee.

114
00:10:17.881 --> 00:10:22.784
- Send backup.
- Bad impersonation? Uhh!

115
00:10:27.757 --> 00:10:29.491
Optimus?

116
00:10:29.526 --> 00:10:32.961
Could we maybe move that
next chat up to right now?

117
00:10:38.434 --> 00:10:41.403
Take it easy. Mine's set on stun.

118
00:10:53.149 --> 00:10:56.885
- Lieutenant Bumblebee, we did it.
- No, I did it.

119
00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.421
And with a giant paperweight
strapped to my arm.

120
00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.825
Thank you both.
Now stand back.

121
00:11:05.461 --> 00:11:07.930
Strongarm, tell the guards
you tried to stop me.

122
00:11:07.964 --> 00:11:11.300
Sideswipe, find another hobby.
Okay?

123
00:11:28.184 --> 00:11:30.052
Earth.

124
00:11:31.321 --> 00:11:32.521
Earth!

125
00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:38.126
What are you doing?
What's he doing here?

126
00:11:38.194 --> 00:11:41.897
Oh. The punk...
Forgot all about him.

127
00:11:41.931 --> 00:11:44.967
Look, I can't be responsible
for you both while I'm...

128
00:11:45.001 --> 00:11:48.070
Strongarm, go back through!
The Space Bridge is gonna close any...

129
00:11:48.104 --> 00:11:54.042
- Sir, ride-along regs. I'm with you.
- Uncuff Sideswipe!

130
00:11:54.077 --> 00:11:57.913
- Yeah, uncuff Sideswipe!
- I know I have violated protocol,

131
00:11:57.947 --> 00:12:00.349
and I will fill out all
the paperwork when...

132
00:12:00.416 --> 00:12:05.253
- Move it, Sideswipe!
- Back to hassle planet Cybertron?

133
00:12:05.288 --> 00:12:08.857
Forget that.
And forget you two.

134
00:12:12.161 --> 00:12:16.865
And I'm stranded on
Earth with two teenagers.

135
00:12:16.899 --> 00:12:18.567
Let's get after him.

136
00:12:18.635 --> 00:12:23.038
- I can't believe I'm really here, sir!
- Me either.

137
00:12:35.151 --> 00:12:38.934
_

138
00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:44.192
Long time ago.

139
00:12:50.099 --> 00:12:55.904
Mayday.
For the 342nd time, mayday.

140
00:12:55.938 --> 00:12:58.874
This is Fixit, caretaker Mini-Con

141
00:12:58.941 --> 00:13:02.477
for the Cybertron max-security
prison ship Alchemor,

142
00:13:02.512 --> 00:13:05.547
still on doo-doo.

143
00:13:05.581 --> 00:13:07.082
Doo-doo?

144
00:13:09.218 --> 00:13:11.987
Duty, ma'am.

145
00:13:12.055 --> 00:13:16.258
Oh, it's so good to see Cybertronian
grills after all these years!

146
00:13:16.292 --> 00:13:18.527
W-Where's your squadron?

147
00:13:18.561 --> 00:13:21.930
I'm afraid we're it.
We didn't know you'd be here.

148
00:13:21.964 --> 00:13:24.499
I'm Lieutenant Bumblebee.
This is Cadet Strongarm.

149
00:13:24.534 --> 00:13:28.336
I'm Fixit, sir. And this is...
uh, was the prison ship Alchemor,

150
00:13:28.371 --> 00:13:31.106
bearing Cybertron's
most wanted Decepticons.

151
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.641
Now, I've reconned the crash site,

152
00:13:32.675 --> 00:13:34.476
and we're missing most
of our stasis cells.

153
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:38.146
Several nearby have ruptured,
their inmates are presumably at large.

154
00:13:38.181 --> 00:13:42.517
- How many is several?
- Oh, a couple of hundred.

155
00:13:43.653 --> 00:13:47.222
In fact, this is the only pod
still intactition. Intachometer.

156
00:13:47.256 --> 00:13:49.124
Unh. Intact.

157
00:13:51.294 --> 00:13:53.995
And its cryo-stasis mechanism

158
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:58.598
- may be a wee bit damaged too.
- Fixit?

159
00:14:00.403 --> 00:14:03.038
Right. Uh, tracking
system just rebooted, sir.

160
00:14:05.174 --> 00:14:07.409
I can't lock onto the
prisoners' locator chips

161
00:14:07.477 --> 00:14:10.512
but I'm definitely getting
a Cybertronian life signal.

162
00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.248
Odds are it's a fooditive.
Uh, fugitive!

163
00:14:13.316 --> 00:14:15.484
Uh, more likely it's Sideswipe.

164
00:14:15.518 --> 00:14:17.953
All right, Fixit, stay
here and continue repairs.

165
00:14:17.987 --> 00:14:19.721
Strongarm, with me.

166
00:14:22.725 --> 00:14:25.060
You're leaving? But I don't
know your favorite colors.

167
00:14:25.094 --> 00:14:28.463
And you don't know mine.
It's red! Call me!

168
00:14:34.804 --> 00:14:37.038
Hello!

169
00:14:50.052 --> 00:14:51.386
Hello!

170
00:14:52.722 --> 00:14:54.623
Hello!

171
00:14:59.662 --> 00:15:04.699
- What are you?
- What are you?

172
00:15:04.734 --> 00:15:07.269
What is that?!

173
00:15:17.313 --> 00:15:20.615
This isn't happening.
Nothing happens here.

174
00:15:20.683 --> 00:15:23.369
Nothing like this happens anywhere!

175
00:15:24.554 --> 00:15:29.291
Hey, crazy meeting someone else
from Cybertron way out here.

176
00:15:31.561 --> 00:15:34.729
A Decepticon. That's cool.

177
00:15:34.764 --> 00:15:35.987
Be ready to roll.

178
00:15:35.988 --> 00:15:38.433
I'm Sideswipe.
And you are?

179
00:15:38.467 --> 00:15:42.204
Underbite.
Heard of me?

180
00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:48.643
- You ever been to Nuon City?
- No...

181
00:15:48.678 --> 00:15:51.513
That's 'cause I ate it!

182
00:16:05.328 --> 00:16:08.563
Little more juice never hurt anyone.

183
00:16:13.402 --> 00:16:17.639
Ah.
Oh, yeah.

184
00:16:19.742 --> 00:16:21.376
Beautiful!

185
00:16:41.264 --> 00:16:44.065
Aren't there any clearings
on this stupid planet?

186
00:16:45.368 --> 00:16:47.369
Follow me!

187
00:16:50.773 --> 00:16:53.508
Wait.
Now we're out in the open.

188
00:16:53.542 --> 00:16:58.246
- How's this better?
- Now I have room to do this.

189
00:17:13.162 --> 00:17:15.864
Whoa...

190
00:17:22.505 --> 00:17:26.808
Yeah, transforming into a car
will make a huge difference.

191
00:17:26.842 --> 00:17:30.345
Hello!
I ate a whole city!

192
00:17:30.379 --> 00:17:33.214
- Get in.
- To you?

193
00:17:34.684 --> 00:17:37.085
Come here!

194
00:17:38.721 --> 00:17:41.589
- Seat belt?
- You're gonna need it.

195
00:17:41.624 --> 00:17:42.791
Aah!

196
00:17:45.428 --> 00:17:48.496
I knew that if I worked
hard and followed the rules,

197
00:17:48.531 --> 00:17:50.632
I might someday receive
an assignment on Earth.

198
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:54.336
Sideswipe just caught
a break he doesn't deserve.

199
00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:55.870
First of all, this isn't
an assignment, Strongarm,

200
00:17:55.905 --> 00:17:59.574
it's a mistake.
Second, go easy on Sideswipe.

201
00:17:59.642 --> 00:18:02.844
He's an okay kid, he just needs
some guidance, and...

202
00:18:09.218 --> 00:18:11.319
Wonderful. We've been
here less than an hour,

203
00:18:11.354 --> 00:18:13.355
and he's already revealed
himself to a human.

204
00:18:13.389 --> 00:18:16.691
Oh, so that's a human?

205
00:18:19.495 --> 00:18:20.962
Run!

206
00:18:26.435 --> 00:18:28.803
I know what you're thinking.

207
00:18:28.838 --> 00:18:35.777
Is that tall, dark and handsome really
Underbite, devourer of Nuon City?

208
00:18:41.217 --> 00:18:43.418
No one recognizes me?

209
00:18:52.228 --> 00:18:54.763
Sideswipe, what did you say to him?

210
00:18:58.901 --> 00:19:03.407
Hey, you're back!

211
00:19:08.978 --> 00:19:11.546
- Human!
- Russell.

212
00:19:13.349 --> 00:19:16.351
Get behind that stasis cell.
Fixit, stay with him.

213
00:19:16.385 --> 00:19:19.220
What's a stasis cell?

214
00:19:26.862 --> 00:19:30.231
I hear fighting!
Who's fighting? I wanna fight!

215
00:19:30.266 --> 00:19:35.336
- Back in your cell. Back!
- Ow!

216
00:19:36.639 --> 00:19:37.806
Watch it. Look out.

217
00:19:39.742 --> 00:19:42.277
Strongarm, Sideswipe, fan out!

218
00:19:52.288 --> 00:19:57.706
Ah, my old stasis pod.
Should give me a little boost.

219
00:19:59.995 --> 00:20:01.930
Mmm...

220
00:20:01.964 --> 00:20:04.399
Feeling the burn!

221
00:20:04.433 --> 00:20:05.934
Hey.

222
00:20:07.069 --> 00:20:10.538
Aren't you Underbite,
the 'Con who ate that city?

223
00:20:11.874 --> 00:20:15.910
Finally! What gave me away?

224
00:20:15.978 --> 00:20:20.648
- The muscles?
- The smell.

225
00:20:29.458 --> 00:20:32.427
How's that smell, you little...

226
00:20:32.461 --> 00:20:35.203
Huh? Where'd he go?

227
00:20:39.835 --> 00:20:41.369
Mm...

228
00:20:43.339 --> 00:20:46.074
Heading for hugeness...

229
00:20:53.782 --> 00:20:57.018
Fixit, I assume that was one
of your escaped prisoners.

230
00:20:57.052 --> 00:20:59.354
- Fixit?
- Yes, sir.

231
00:21:05.461 --> 00:21:07.562
A Chompazoid named Underbite.

232
00:21:10.099 --> 00:21:12.367
The more metal a Chompazoid consumes,

233
00:21:12.401 --> 00:21:15.503
- the more powerful it becomes.
- So it's not good

234
00:21:15.571 --> 00:21:17.872
that he's headed for
a metal graveyard, then.

235
00:21:19.775 --> 00:21:21.843
If Underbite gets all
that into his jaws,

236
00:21:21.877 --> 00:21:23.444
we'll never bring him down.

237
00:21:23.479 --> 00:21:25.847
Wait, do you mean the scrap yard?

238
00:21:25.881 --> 00:21:27.849
My Dad's in there!
