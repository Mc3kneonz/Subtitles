1
00:00:02,099 --> 00:00:04,166
Cybertron.

2
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:06,903
My name is Bumblebee, and
I keep the peace around here.

3
00:00:06,937 --> 00:00:09,122
Try to, anyway.

4
00:00:09,934 --> 00:00:11,240
We have a 2-1-1 in progress.

5
00:00:21,885 --> 00:00:23,853
Get it in gear, Cadet Strongarm.

6
00:00:23,887 --> 00:00:26,389
Whatever we're doing, I am honored.

7
00:00:26,423 --> 00:00:30,159
After all, you were there,
right alongside Optimus Prime.

8
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:32,133
But...?

9
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:36,098
It's just, after all you and
Optimus did for Cybertron,

10
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:39,201
I'm surprised you weren't
made something more...

11
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:42,204
prestigious than a street cop.

12
00:00:45,275 --> 00:00:47,443
That has to be our disturbance.

13
00:01:04,995 --> 00:01:08,998
In front of the Optimus statue!

14
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:15,404
- That punk is going down.
- That punk is Sideswipe,

15
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,940
and while he's about as
exciting as this job gets,

16
00:01:17,975 --> 00:01:21,277
he's not actually dangerous.
I'll just...[shocked]

17
00:01:34,725 --> 00:01:40,022
- Sir? What is it?
- D-Do you see that?

18
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:48,637
That's okay, Lieutenant, you meditate.
I'll handle this perp.

19
00:01:54,077 --> 00:01:55,378
Optimus?

20
00:02:04,588 --> 00:02:06,088
Earth?

21
00:02:09,593 --> 00:02:12,461
Stop, or I'll... Aah!

22
00:02:12,496 --> 00:02:15,564
Eat my exhaust? Whoo!

23
00:02:20,337 --> 00:02:24,473
- Whoo! All right! Ha, ha, yeah!
- Pull over!

24
00:02:31,581 --> 00:02:33,382
Oof.

25
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,523
W-What?
You crazy?

26
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:45,661
Optimus Prime!

27
00:02:47,497 --> 00:02:49,065
Lieutenant!

28
00:03:12,589 --> 00:03:14,223
No!

29
00:03:24,668 --> 00:03:26,569
Optimus...

30
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:32,708
Lieutenant, are you talking
to the statue's head?

31
00:03:35,178 --> 00:03:38,091
Brain rust.

32
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:41,217
- So sad.
- Show some respect!

33
00:03:41,251 --> 00:03:45,387
You can't turn left on Cybertron
without breaking some law.

34
00:03:45,422 --> 00:03:49,191
Cadet Strongarm, take Sideswipe
down to the station for processing.

35
00:03:49,226 --> 00:03:52,128
- Seriously?
- Sir, ride-along regulation

36
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:54,363
201, section 4, requires that I...

37
00:03:54,397 --> 00:03:57,117
Uh, I'll meet you there.

38
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,868
Good plan, sir.

39
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:31,167
Wha...?

40
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:35,604
- Rusty!
- It's Russell.

41
00:04:35,672 --> 00:04:40,476
Come on, son.
You're not that grown up. Not yet.

42
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,812
Hey, we're going to
have a blast and a half

43
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,350
- while you're mom's away working in...
- Copenhagen?

44
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:53,589
You know, a real city?
Like the one across the river?

45
00:04:53,623 --> 00:04:56,192
I never get into Crown City.

46
00:04:56,259 --> 00:05:01,764
I... We have everything
we need right here.

47
00:05:05,468 --> 00:05:10,206
- Except excitement.
- Aw, Rust... Russell.

48
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,876
I still have a lot of the stuff
you used to love playing with.

49
00:05:13,944 --> 00:05:16,212
Because you won't sell anything.

50
00:05:16,246 --> 00:05:20,616
And check this out.
It's the 14th Street Diner.

51
00:05:20,684 --> 00:05:24,620
They were gonna tear it down,
so I had it moved here piece by piece.

52
00:05:24,688 --> 00:05:26,355
Isn't it awesome?

53
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:29,625
It's kinda weird.
Like living in a scrap yard.

54
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:35,920
Please. Vintage salvage depot
for the discriminating nostalgist.

55
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,739
W-Was that an earthquake?

56
00:05:49,746 --> 00:05:53,716
Uhh.
May-d-d-day.

57
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,619
M-Mayday.

58
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:05,227
Welcome to the Cybertron History Museum.

59
00:06:05,262 --> 00:06:07,963
- Do you need a map?
- No, thank you.

60
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:27,316
A Space Bridge.

61
00:06:31,321 --> 00:06:33,355
Are these Earth coordinates?

62
00:06:35,892 --> 00:06:39,995
Bumblebee.
I knew you would understand.

63
00:06:42,766 --> 00:06:47,469
Optimus? Is it really you?
Where are you?

64
00:06:47,504 --> 00:06:49,872
I need you on Earth, Bumblebee.

65
00:06:49,906 --> 00:06:53,342
A new mission. A dire threat.

66
00:06:53,376 --> 00:06:54,777
Me?

67
00:06:54,811 --> 00:06:58,614
Go there, and we shall speak again.

68
00:06:58,648 --> 00:07:01,583
- Can't you tell me...
- Lieutenant?

69
00:07:03,753 --> 00:07:08,791
Please take me to jail!
This place is so much worse.

70
00:07:08,825 --> 00:07:12,594
- Strongarm, I told you to...
- With all due respect, sir,

71
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:17,599
regulation 201, section 4:
a ride-along shall accompany

72
00:07:17,634 --> 00:07:22,805
a senior officer for an entire shift,
no exceptions. So...

73
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:27,776
Okay.
I've been following a trail.

74
00:07:27,811 --> 00:07:31,947
One that you two apparently can't see.
A trail laid out for me by...

75
00:07:32,505 --> 00:07:34,049
Optimus Prime.

76
00:07:34,117 --> 00:07:39,655
- The Optimus Prime?
- Who is no longer alive?

77
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:44,493
Optimus Prime wants to send
us to Earth? I am so, so in!

78
00:07:44,527 --> 00:07:49,631
No, you're out.
It's a mission for me. Alone.

79
00:07:59,008 --> 00:08:00,909
Ah, guards.

80
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:05,013
I'll keep them busy.
Please see if there's a way

81
00:08:05,048 --> 00:08:07,716
to disable those stasis
fields around the Space Bridge.

82
00:08:07,751 --> 00:08:09,651
Tampering with museum property?

83
00:08:09,686 --> 00:08:14,089
Sir, you know that violates
Protocol Section 116, Paragraph...

84
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,462
He's Bumblebee.
He must have a good reason, right?

85
00:08:20,497 --> 00:08:23,048
You're a punk.
You know how to take out

86
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:25,534
- security systems, don't you?
- No!

87
00:08:26,836 --> 00:08:28,158
Maybe.

88
00:08:28,972 --> 00:08:32,441
Experts say the tremor downtown
Crown City just experienced

89
00:08:32,475 --> 00:08:34,877
was from a low-level sonic
boom just across the river.

90
00:08:34,911 --> 00:08:37,112
Scientists suspect
a meteor might have finished

91
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,716
burning up while passing
through Earth's atmosphere.

92
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,753
Meteor?
Exploration time.

93
00:08:44,821 --> 00:08:46,789
You mean "wander through the woods

94
00:08:46,856 --> 00:08:50,159
looking for a sliver of rock
that probably isn't there" time?

95
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:55,097
We'll have to go treasure hunting later.
That's my 9:00 a.m.

96
00:08:55,131 --> 00:08:58,801
He wants to sell a full
set of life-size aluminum

97
00:08:58,868 --> 00:09:02,004
Billy the Breakfast Beaver figures.

98
00:09:03,473 --> 00:09:06,108
Wanna help your old man close the deal?

99
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:09,711
Uh, why don't I go see
if I can find that meteor?

100
00:09:09,746 --> 00:09:13,916
Divide and conquer.
Great plan.

101
00:09:24,027 --> 00:09:27,429
Okay, stay calm, speak clearly.

102
00:09:28,798 --> 00:09:31,400
Mayday.
Mayday, Cybertron Control.

103
00:09:31,434 --> 00:09:34,169
If you can hear me,
this is maximum security

104
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,606
prison ship Alchemor.
We have crashed on an unknown planet.

105
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,175
Many of the containment
pods were disengaged,

106
00:09:40,243 --> 00:09:42,678
but the one I can see
still appears to be intact,

107
00:09:42,712 --> 00:09:46,448
so I'm hopeful none
of the prisoners has...

108
00:09:46,483 --> 00:09:51,019
Uh, Control?
Updating that last report...

109
00:09:51,054 --> 00:09:57,826
- Hey, all clear back there.
- Wait, aren't you... Bumblebee?

110
00:09:57,861 --> 00:10:00,929
- You're working here now?
- Yeah, just started today.

111
00:10:00,964 --> 00:10:04,566
- No, disable that relay.
- Don't touch!

112
00:10:04,601 --> 00:10:08,604
- You guys are the real heroes.
- What's going on?

113
00:10:15,545 --> 00:10:17,846
Intruder doing a bad
impersonation of Bumblebee.

114
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:22,784
- Send backup.
- Bad impersonation? Uhh!

115
00:10:27,757 --> 00:10:29,491
Optimus?

116
00:10:29,526 --> 00:10:32,961
Could we maybe move that
next chat up to right now?

117
00:10:38,434 --> 00:10:41,403
Take it easy. Mine's set on stun.

118
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:56,885
- Lieutenant Bumblebee, we did it.
- No, I did it.

119
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,421
And with a giant paperweight
strapped to my arm.

120
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,825
Thank you both.
Now stand back.

121
00:11:05,461 --> 00:11:07,930
Strongarm, tell the guards
you tried to stop me.

122
00:11:07,964 --> 00:11:11,300
Sideswipe, find another hobby.
Okay?

123
00:11:28,184 --> 00:11:30,052
Earth.

124
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:32,521
Earth!

125
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:38,126
What are you doing?
What's he doing here?

126
00:11:38,194 --> 00:11:41,897
Oh. The punk...
Forgot all about him.

127
00:11:41,931 --> 00:11:44,967
Look, I can't be responsible
for you both while I'm...

128
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:48,070
Strongarm, go back through!
The Space Bridge is gonna close any...

129
00:11:48,104 --> 00:11:54,042
- Sir, ride-along regs. I'm with you.
- Uncuff Sideswipe!

130
00:11:54,077 --> 00:11:57,913
- Yeah, uncuff Sideswipe!
- I know I have violated protocol,

131
00:11:57,947 --> 00:12:00,349
and I will fill out all
the paperwork when...

132
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:05,253
- Move it, Sideswipe!
- Back to hassle planet Cybertron?

133
00:12:05,288 --> 00:12:08,857
Forget that.
And forget you two.

134
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:16,865
And I'm stranded on
Earth with two teenagers.

135
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:18,567
Let's get after him.

136
00:12:18,635 --> 00:12:23,038
- I can't believe I'm really here, sir!
- Me either.

137
00:12:35,151 --> 00:12:38,934
_

138
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:44,192
Long time ago.

139
00:12:50,099 --> 00:12:55,904
Mayday.
For the 342nd time, mayday.

140
00:12:55,938 --> 00:12:58,874
This is Fixit, caretaker Mini-Con

141
00:12:58,941 --> 00:13:02,477
for the Cybertron max-security
prison ship Alchemor,

142
00:13:02,512 --> 00:13:05,547
still on doo-doo.

143
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:07,082
Doo-doo?

144
00:13:09,218 --> 00:13:11,987
Duty, ma'am.

145
00:13:12,055 --> 00:13:16,258
Oh, it's so good to see Cybertronian
grills after all these years!

146
00:13:16,292 --> 00:13:18,527
W-Where's your squadron?

147
00:13:18,561 --> 00:13:21,930
I'm afraid we're it.
We didn't know you'd be here.

148
00:13:21,964 --> 00:13:24,499
I'm Lieutenant Bumblebee.
This is Cadet Strongarm.

149
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:28,336
I'm Fixit, sir. And this is...
uh, was the prison ship Alchemor,

150
00:13:28,371 --> 00:13:31,106
bearing Cybertron's
most wanted Decepticons.

151
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,641
Now, I've reconned the crash site,

152
00:13:32,675 --> 00:13:34,476
and we're missing most
of our stasis cells.

153
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:38,146
Several nearby have ruptured,
their inmates are presumably at large.

154
00:13:38,181 --> 00:13:42,517
- How many is several?
- Oh, a couple of hundred.

155
00:13:43,653 --> 00:13:47,222
In fact, this is the only pod
still intactition. Intachometer.

156
00:13:47,256 --> 00:13:49,124
Unh. Intact.

157
00:13:51,294 --> 00:13:53,995
And its cryo-stasis mechanism

158
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:58,598
- may be a wee bit damaged too.
- Fixit?

159
00:14:00,403 --> 00:14:03,038
Right. Uh, tracking
system just rebooted, sir.

160
00:14:05,174 --> 00:14:07,409
I can't lock onto the
prisoners' locator chips

161
00:14:07,477 --> 00:14:10,512
but I'm definitely getting
a Cybertronian life signal.

162
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,248
Odds are it's a fooditive.
Uh, fugitive!

163
00:14:13,316 --> 00:14:15,484
Uh, more likely it's Sideswipe.

164
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:17,953
All right, Fixit, stay
here and continue repairs.

165
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:19,721
Strongarm, with me.

166
00:14:22,725 --> 00:14:25,060
You're leaving? But I don't
know your favorite colors.

167
00:14:25,094 --> 00:14:28,463
And you don't know mine.
It's red! Call me!

168
00:14:34,804 --> 00:14:37,038
Hello!

169
00:14:50,052 --> 00:14:51,386
Hello!

170
00:14:52,722 --> 00:14:54,623
Hello!

171
00:14:59,662 --> 00:15:04,699
- What are you?
- What are you?

172
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:07,269
What is that?!

173
00:15:17,313 --> 00:15:20,615
This isn't happening.
Nothing happens here.

174
00:15:20,683 --> 00:15:23,369
Nothing like this happens anywhere!

175
00:15:24,554 --> 00:15:29,291
Hey, crazy meeting someone else
from Cybertron way out here.

176
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:34,729
A Decepticon. That's cool.

177
00:15:34,764 --> 00:15:35,987
Be ready to roll.

178
00:15:35,988 --> 00:15:38,433
I'm Sideswipe.
And you are?

179
00:15:38,467 --> 00:15:42,204
Underbite.
Heard of me?

180
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,643
- You ever been to Nuon City?
- No...

181
00:15:48,678 --> 00:15:51,513
That's 'cause I ate it!

182
00:16:05,328 --> 00:16:08,563
Little more juice never hurt anyone.

183
00:16:13,402 --> 00:16:17,639
Ah.
Oh, yeah.

184
00:16:19,742 --> 00:16:21,376
Beautiful!

185
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:44,065
Aren't there any clearings
on this stupid planet?

186
00:16:45,368 --> 00:16:47,369
Follow me!

187
00:16:50,773 --> 00:16:53,508
Wait.
Now we're out in the open.

188
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:58,246
- How's this better?
- Now I have room to do this.

189
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:15,864
Whoa...

190
00:17:22,505 --> 00:17:26,808
Yeah, transforming into a car
will make a huge difference.

191
00:17:26,842 --> 00:17:30,345
Hello!
I ate a whole city!

192
00:17:30,379 --> 00:17:33,214
- Get in.
- To you?

193
00:17:34,684 --> 00:17:37,085
Come here!

194
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:41,589
- Seat belt?
- You're gonna need it.

195
00:17:41,624 --> 00:17:42,791
Aah!

196
00:17:45,428 --> 00:17:48,496
I knew that if I worked
hard and followed the rules,

197
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:50,632
I might someday receive
an assignment on Earth.

198
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,336
Sideswipe just caught
a break he doesn't deserve.

199
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,870
First of all, this isn't
an assignment, Strongarm,

200
00:17:55,905 --> 00:17:59,574
it's a mistake.
Second, go easy on Sideswipe.

201
00:17:59,642 --> 00:18:02,844
He's an okay kid, he just needs
some guidance, and...

202
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:11,319
Wonderful. We've been
here less than an hour,

203
00:18:11,354 --> 00:18:13,355
and he's already revealed
himself to a human.

204
00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:16,691
Oh, so that's a human?

205
00:18:19,495 --> 00:18:20,962
Run!

206
00:18:26,435 --> 00:18:28,803
I know what you're thinking.

207
00:18:28,838 --> 00:18:35,777
Is that tall, dark and handsome really
Underbite, devourer of Nuon City?

208
00:18:41,217 --> 00:18:43,418
No one recognizes me?

209
00:18:52,228 --> 00:18:54,763
Sideswipe, what did you say to him?

210
00:18:58,901 --> 00:19:03,407
Hey, you're back!

211
00:19:08,978 --> 00:19:11,546
- Human!
- Russell.

212
00:19:13,349 --> 00:19:16,351
Get behind that stasis cell.
Fixit, stay with him.

213
00:19:16,385 --> 00:19:19,220
What's a stasis cell?

214
00:19:26,862 --> 00:19:30,231
I hear fighting!
Who's fighting? I wanna fight!

215
00:19:30,266 --> 00:19:35,336
- Back in your cell. Back!
- Ow!

216
00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:37,806
Watch it. Look out.

217
00:19:39,742 --> 00:19:42,277
Strongarm, Sideswipe, fan out!

218
00:19:52,288 --> 00:19:57,706
Ah, my old stasis pod.
Should give me a little boost.

219
00:19:59,995 --> 00:20:01,930
Mmm...

220
00:20:01,964 --> 00:20:04,399
Feeling the burn!

221
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:05,934
Hey.

222
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:10,538
Aren't you Underbite,
the 'Con who ate that city?

223
00:20:11,874 --> 00:20:15,910
Finally! What gave me away?

224
00:20:15,978 --> 00:20:20,648
- The muscles?
- The smell.

225
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,427
How's that smell, you little...

226
00:20:32,461 --> 00:20:35,203
Huh? Where'd he go?

227
00:20:39,835 --> 00:20:41,369
Mm...

228
00:20:43,339 --> 00:20:46,074
Heading for hugeness...

229
00:20:53,782 --> 00:20:57,018
Fixit, I assume that was one
of your escaped prisoners.

230
00:20:57,052 --> 00:20:59,354
- Fixit?
- Yes, sir.

231
00:21:05,461 --> 00:21:07,562
A Chompazoid named Underbite.

232
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:12,367
The more metal a Chompazoid consumes,

233
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:15,503
- the more powerful it becomes.
- So it's not good

234
00:21:15,571 --> 00:21:17,872
that he's headed for
a metal graveyard, then.

235
00:21:19,775 --> 00:21:21,843
If Underbite gets all
that into his jaws,

236
00:21:21,877 --> 00:21:23,444
we'll never bring him down.

237
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:25,847
Wait, do you mean the scrap yard?

238
00:21:25,881 --> 00:21:27,849
My Dad's in there!
